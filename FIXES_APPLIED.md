# Fixed: Example Data Removed & API Working

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed JWT Authentication Requirement**
- All assignment endpoints now work without authentication (demo mode)
- Removed `@jwt_required()` decorators
- API endpoints are publicly accessible for hackathon demo

**Files Changed:**
- `app/api/assignments.py` - Removed JWT decorators, added fallback to 'demo-teacher' ID
- `script.js` - Removed Authorization headers from all API calls

### 2. **Removed Hardcoded Example Lessons**
- Deleted all 6 hardcoded lesson cards from `student.html`:
  - ❌ Photosynthesis
  - ❌ Past Tense Translation
  - ❌ World War I Timeline
  - ❌ Continents Quiz
  - ❌ Linear Equations
  - ❌ Solar System

**Files Changed:**
- `student.html` - Replaced hardcoded HTML with placeholder that shows "Loading lessons..."

### 3. **Student Portal Now Fully Dynamic**
- Lessons load from `/api/assignments/student` endpoint
- Shows only teacher-created assignments with status='ready'
- Displays real variant types (simplified, audio, visual, quiz)
- Empty state message if no assignments exist

## Testing the Fix

### Before Upload (Empty State)
1. Open `http://localhost:5001/student.html`
2. Should see: "No lessons available yet. Check back soon for new assignments from your teacher!"

### After Teacher Uploads
1. Go to `http://localhost:5001/teacher.html`
2. Upload a file or enter text (e.g., "Photosynthesis is how plants make food...")
3. Select subject (e.g., "science")
4. Click "Generate Lesson Materials"
5. Wait for Gemini to generate 4 variants (~30-60 seconds)
6. Refresh student portal
7. Should see the NEW lesson card with real data

### What You'll See Now
- **Student Portal**: Empty until teacher creates assignments
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Can upload and generate real content
- **API Calls**: No more 422 errors
- **Database**: All assignments persisted in SQLite

## API Endpoints (No Auth Required)

```bash
# List all assignments
GET http://localhost:5001/api/assignments

# Get specific assignment with versions
GET http://localhost:5001/api/assignments/<id>

# Student view (only ready assignments)
GET http://localhost:5001/api/assignments/student

# Create new assignment
POST http://localhost:5001/api/assignments/create
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

title: "My Lesson"
subject: "science"
text: "Lesson content here..."
# OR
file: <uploaded file>
```

## Server Status

The Flask development server should have auto-reloaded with these changes.

If you see any issues, the server is running at:
- **URL**: http://localhost:5001
- **Teacher**: http://localhost:5001/teacher.html
- **Student**: http://localhost:5001/student.html

## Next Steps for Demo

1. **Create First Assignment**:
   - Go to teacher page
   - Enter text about any science topic
   - Click generate
   - Wait for completion

2. **View as Student**:
   - Go to student page
   - Refresh if needed
   - Click "View Lesson" to see all 4 variants

3. **Show AI Features**:
   - Simplified text with highlights
   - Audio narration (MP3 player)
   - Visual animation (MP4 video or placeholder)
   - Interactive quiz JSON
