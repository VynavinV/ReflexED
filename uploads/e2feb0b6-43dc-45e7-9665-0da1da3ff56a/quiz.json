      "question": "Factor the quadratic expression: x\u00b2 + 9x + 18",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "solution": "We need two numbers that multiply to 18 and add up to 9. These numbers are 3 and 6. So, the factored form is (x + 3)(x + 6).",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "solution": "Recognize this as a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). Here, a = \u221a(25y\u00b2) = 5y and b = \u221a49 = 7. So, the factored form is (5y - 7)(5y + 7).",

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "solution": "The square root of 81 is 9 (since 9\u00b2 = 81). The cube root of 64 is 4 (since 4\u00b3 = 64). So, 9 + 4 = 13.",

Add to -4, get -2. Multiply -2 by -2, get 4. Add to -4, get 0. The quotient is x\u00b2 - x - 2. Now factor this quadratic: (x - 2)(x + 1). So, the factors are (x + 2), (x - 2), and (x + 1).",
