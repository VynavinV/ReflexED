      "answer": "As x approaches positive infinity, y approaches positive infinity. As x approaches negative infinity, y approaches negative infinity.",
      "difficulty": "easy",

      "answer": "As x approaches positive infinity, y approaches negative infinity. As x approaches negative infinity, y approaches positive infinity.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "solution": "The leading term is -2x^5. Since the degree is odd and the leading coefficient is negative, the end behavior is: As x -> infinity, y -> -infinity; As x -> -infinity, y -> infinity.",

      "answer": "x = 2 (multiplicity 1), x = -1 (multiplicity 1), x = 3 (multiplicity 1)",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "solution": "Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.  The exponent of each factor is 1, so each zero has a multiplicity of 1.",

      "answer": "x-intercepts: x = 1 (multiplicity 2), x = -2 (multiplicity 1). The graph touches the x-axis at x=1 and crosses the x-axis at x=-2.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "solution": "The x-intercepts are found by setting y=0. The factor (x-1)^2 gives x=1 with multiplicity 2, meaning the graph touches the x-axis at x=1. The factor (x+2) gives x=-2 with multiplicity 1, meaning the graph crosses the x-axis at x=-2.",

      "answer": "3",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "solution": "The maximum number of turning points is one less than the degree of the polynomial.  Since the degree is 4, the maximum number of turning points is 4 - 1 = 3.",

      "difficulty": "medium",
      "solution": "Even degree with positive leading coefficient means both ends go up. Turning points can be any number from 0 to n-1, where n is the degree.",

      "answer": "f(x) = x^2(x + 3)(x - 1)",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "solution": "A zero at x = -3 corresponds to a factor of (x + 3). A zero at x = 0 with multiplicity 2 corresponds to a factor of x^2. A zero at x = 1 corresponds to a factor of (x - 1). Multiplying these factors gives the polynomial.",

      "answer": "Positive: (-2, 0) and (2, infinity). Negative: (-infinity, -2) and (0, 2).",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "solution": "First, find the zeros: x^3 - 4x = x(x^2 - 4) = x(x - 2)(x + 2). The zeros are x = -2, 0, and 2. Create a sign chart using test values in each interval: (-infinity, -2), (-2, 0), (0, 2), and (2, infinity). Determine the sign of f(x) in each interval. Then state the intervals where f(x) is positive and negative.",

      "question": "Given the graph of a polynomial with x-intercepts at -1, 2, and 3, and y-intercept at 6, write a possible equation for the polynomial.",
      "answer": "f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 6",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "solution": "Since we have three x-intercepts, we know that the polynomial is at least degree 3.  The x intercepts are -1, 2, and 3, so the factors are (x+1), (x-2), and (x-3).  So the polynomial is f(x) = a(x+1)(x-2)(x-3).  To find a, we plug in the y-intercept, which is (0,6).  So 6 = a(0+1)(0-2)(0-3) = a(1)(-2)(-3) = 6a.  So a = 1.  Therefore, f(x) = (x+1)(x-2)(x-3) = x^3 - 4x^2 + x + 6.",
