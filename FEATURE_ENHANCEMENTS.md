# PolyLearn Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive improvements to the PolyLearn educational platform with AI-powered content generation featuring podcast-style audio, full educational videos, and subject-specific quiz types.

---

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Podcast-Style Audio Narration** 🎙️
**Problem:** Audio was word-for-word reading of notes, not engaging or educational.

**Solution:**
- Created podcast discussion format with two voices (Host and Expert)
- Gemini generates natural dialogue that teaches concepts through conversation
- Uses ElevenLabs API with two different voice IDs:
  - Host: Female voice (Sarah - EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL)
  - Expert: Male voice (George - JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb)
- Audio segments stitched together with pydub with 500ms pauses
- Frontend displays beautiful podcast transcript with color-coded speakers

**Files Modified:**
- `app/services/assignment_service.py` - Updated `_gen_audio_script()` and added `_synthesize_podcast()`
- `script.js` - Enhanced audio display with podcast transcript viewer

---

### 2. **Full Educational Videos** 🎬
**Problem:** Videos were only 3 seconds long (just intro).

**Solution:**
- Updated Gemini prompts to create 30-60 second full lessons
- Videos now include multiple scenes that build on each other
- Added narration timeline tied to visuals
- Generates comprehensive Manim code with text, diagrams, and animations
- Frontend displays narration segments with timing

**Files Modified:**
- `app/services/assignment_service.py` - Updated `_gen_visual_plan()` with enhanced prompts
- `script.js` - Added narration timeline display for videos

---

### 3. **Subject-Specific Quiz Types** 🧠
**Problem:** Quiz showed placeholder text, no actual content displayed. All subjects had same generic quiz format.

**Solution:** Implemented 5 different quiz types tailored to each subject:

#### **Language** - Socratic Questioning
- Guides students to discover answers themselves
- Progressive questions building on previous answers
- Includes guidance hints and follow-up prompts
- Interactive text areas for student responses

#### **Math** - Practice Problems
- 8-10 problems with varying difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- Step-by-step solutions
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Difficulty badges with color coding

#### **Science** - Repeatable Practice Questions
- 8-10 questions for mastery through repetition
- Detailed explanations
- Real-world applications
- "Did you know?" interesting facts

#### **History** - Timeline & Famous Names Fill-in
- Timeline events with year badges
- Fill-in-the-blank for historical events
- Famous people descriptions
- Significance explanations

#### **Geography** - Repeatable Practice Questions
- 8-10 location/feature questions
- Helpful hints
- Interesting geographical facts
- Visual year/date displays

**Files Modified:**
- `app/services/assignment_service.py` - Completely rewrote `_gen_quiz()` with subject-specific logic
- `script.js` - Added 5 new render functions: `renderSocraticQuiz()`, `renderPracticeQuiz()`, `renderRepeatablePractice()`, `renderTimelineFill()`, `renderStandardQuiz()`

## 🎯 How It Works

### Teacher Workflow:
1. Upload file OR enter text OR both
2. Select subject (language, math, science, history, geography)
3. Click "Generate Materials"
4. System creates 4 variants:
   - ✨ Simplified Text
   - 🎙️ Podcast Discussion (2 voices)
   - 🎬 Full Educational Video (with narration timeline)
   - 🧠 Subject-Specific Quiz

### Student Workflow:
1. Browse lessons by subject
2. Choose learning style:
   - **Audio learners** → Listen to podcast discussion
   - **Visual learners** → Watch full animated video  
   - **Reading/Writing** → Read simplified text
   - **Practice** → Complete subject-specific quiz
3. Interactive elements:
