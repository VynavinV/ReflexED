# Delete Assignment Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Feature Added: Delete Buttons on Teacher Dashboard

### 🎯 What Was Added

**Delete buttons** have been added to each assignment in the teacher dashboard's "My Recent Lessons" section, allowing teachers to easily remove assignments they no longer need.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **JavaScript (`script.js`)**

#### A. Updated Lesson Rendering
Added `data-assignment-id` attribute and delete button to each lesson item:

```javascript
<div class="lesson-item" data-assignment-id="${a.id}">
    <div class="lesson-info">
        <span class="lesson-subject ${subjectClass}">${a.subject}</span>
        <h3>${escapeHtml(a.title)}</h3>
        <p>${timeText} • ${statusBadge}</p>
    </div>
    <div class="lesson-actions">
        <button class="btn btn-outline btn-sm" onclick="viewAssignment('${a.id}')">View</button>
        <button class="btn btn-danger btn-sm" onclick="deleteAssignment('${a.id}', event)">
            🗑️ Delete
        </button>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### B. Added `deleteAssignment()` Function
New async function that:
- ✅ Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
- ✅ Calls DELETE API endpoint
- ✅ Animates removal from UI (fade out + slide)
- ✅ Shows success notification
- ✅ Updates empty state if no lessons remain
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully

```javascript
async function deleteAssignment(assignmentId, event) {
    // Confirmation
    const confirmed = confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this assignment?');
    if (!confirmed) return;
    
    // API call
    const response = await fetch(`/api/assignments/${assignmentId}`, {
        method: 'DELETE'
    });
    
    // Remove from UI with animation
    const lessonItem = document.querySelector(`[data-assignment-id="${assignmentId}"]`);
    lessonItem.style.opacity = '0';
    lessonItem.style.transform = 'translateX(-20px)';
    
    // Show success notification
    showNotification('Assignment deleted successfully', 'success');
}
```

---

### 2. **CSS (`styles.css`)**

Added `.btn-danger` styling for delete buttons:

```css
.btn-danger {
    background: #DC2626;
    color: var(--white);
    border: 2px solid #DC2626;
}

.btn-danger:hover {
    background: #B91C1C;
    border-color: #B91C1C;
    transform: translateY(-2px);
    box-shadow: var(--shadow-md);
}
```

**Colors:**
- Normal: Red (#DC2626)
- Hover: Darker Red (#B91C1C)
- Matches modern danger/destructive action patterns

---

### 3. **Backend (Already Implemented)**

The DELETE endpoint was previously added to `app/api/assignments.py`:

```python
@assignments_bp.route('/<assignment_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_assignment(assignment_id):
    """Delete an assignment and all its associated data."""
    # Deletes:
    # - Assignment record from database
    # - All variant versions
    # - All uploaded files and generated content
    return jsonify({'success': True, 'message': 'Assignment deleted successfully'})
```

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### Before Deletion:
1. Teacher sees list of assignments with **View** and **Delete** buttons
2. Delete button is styled in red to indicate destructive action

### During Deletion:
1. Click **Delete** button
2. Browser confirmation dialog appears: "Are you sure you want to delete this assignment? This action cannot be undone."
3. If confirmed, assignment fades out and slides left (0.3s animation)
4. Success notification appears: "Assignment deleted successfully"

### After Deletion:
1. Assignment is removed from the list
2. If no assignments remain, shows helpful message:
   > "No lessons created yet. Upload your first assignment above!"

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### 1. **Confirmation Dialog**
- User must confirm before deletion
- Warning message: "This action cannot be undone"

### 2. **Error Handling**
- Handles network errors gracefully
- Shows error message if deletion fails
- Assignment remains in list if deletion fails

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
- Smooth animation on removal
- Success notification
- Red color indicates danger/caution

### 4. **Event Bubbling Prevention**
- `event.stopPropagation()` prevents accidental triggers
- Button click doesn't trigger parent element clicks
