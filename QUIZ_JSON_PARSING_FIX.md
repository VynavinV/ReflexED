# Quiz Generation JSON Parsing Fix

## Problem
The quiz generation feature was experiencing JSON parsing failures due to the Gemini API returning responses wrapped in markdown code blocks (e.g., ````json...````) and sometimes including trailing commas or other JSON formatting issues.

**Error messages observed:**
```
⚠️ JSON parsing failed: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 92 column 6 (char 5264)
⚠️ Received text (first 200 chars): ```json
{
  "summary": "Practice problems to master factoring, perfect squares/cubes...",
```

## Root Cause
The `_parse_json()` method in `app/services/assignment_service.py` was:
1. Not robustly handling markdown code block extraction
2. Not cleaning up common JSON issues like trailing commas
3. Not removing comments that might appear in the response

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced JSON Parser (`_parse_json` method)
Added the following improvements:

- **Better markdown extraction**: Improved regex pattern with `re.IGNORECASE` flag
- **Trailing comma removal**: Automatically strips trailing commas before `}` and `]`
- **Comment removal**: Strips `//` and `/* */` style comments
- **Better error reporting**: Shows both original and cleaned text for debugging

```python
# Remove trailing commas before closing braces/brackets
cleaned = re.sub(r',(\s*[}\]])', r'\1', cleaned)

# Remove comments (// and /* */)
cleaned = re.sub(r'//[^\n]*', '', cleaned)
cleaned = re.sub(r'/\*.*?\*/', '', cleaned, flags=re.DOTALL)
```

### 2. Updated All Quiz Prompts
Enhanced all quiz generation prompts with explicit instructions:

```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no code blocks, no explanations
2. Do NOT wrap the JSON in ```json or ``` markers
3. Do NOT include trailing commas before closing braces or brackets
4. Start your response directly with { and end with }
```

Updated prompts for:
- ✅ Math quizzes (`practice` type)
- ✅ Language quizzes (`socratic` type)
- ✅ Science quizzes (`practice_repeatable` type)
- ✅ History quizzes (`timeline_fill` type)
- ✅ Geography quizzes (`practice_repeatable` type)

### 3. Improved Example Formats
Changed all quiz prompt examples to use properly formatted, multiline JSON (instead of compact single-line) to make it clearer what valid JSON looks like:

**Before:**
```json
{"question": "...", "answer": "...", "difficulty": "easy"},
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "question": "...",
  "answer": "...",
  "difficulty": "easy"
}
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_json_parsing.py`) covering:
- ✅ JSON wrapped in markdown code blocks
- ✅ JSON with trailing commas
- ✅ JSON with comments
- ✅ JSON embedded in text
- ✅ Empty responses

All tests pass successfully.

## Expected Outcome
- Quiz generation should now succeed on first attempt in most cases
- Reduced reliance on retry mechanism (though it's still available as fallback)
- Better error messages when parsing still fails
- More reliable quiz creation for all subjects

## Files Modified
- `app/services/assignment_service.py` - Enhanced `_parse_json()` method and all quiz prompts
- `test_json_parsing.py` - New test file to validate improvements

## Next Steps (if issues persist)
1. Monitor server logs for any remaining parsing failures
2. If specific patterns still cause issues, add them to the test suite
3. Consider adding a JSON schema validation step
4. Potentially switch to a more structured output format (e.g., using function calling)
