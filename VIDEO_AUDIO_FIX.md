# Video Audio Fix - Quick Summary

## ✅ Problem Fixed

**Issue**: Manim-generated videos had no audio
**Solution**: Added ElevenLabs narration to all video lessons

## 🔧 What Changed

### 1. Audio Generation for Videos
- Extracts narration text from Gemini's visual plan
- Synthesizes speech using ElevenLabs API
- Saves as `narration.mp3`

### 2. Video-Audio Combination
- Uses ffmpeg to merge Manim video + narration audio
- Creates final `visual.mp4` with synchronized voiceover
- Fallback to silent video if ffmpeg unavailable

### 3. New Method Added
```python
_add_audio_to_video(video_path, audio_path, out_dir, name)
```
- Combines video and audio streams using ffmpeg
- Returns path to final video with audio

## 🎬 How to Test

### Create New Assignment
1. Go to Teacher view
2. Create assignment with any subject/text
3. Wait for generation (~30-60 seconds)
4. Check video in Student view - should have narration!

### Verify Audio Exists
```bash
# Check if video has audio stream
ffprobe uploads/[assignment-id]/visual.mp4

# Should show:
# - codec_type=video (h264)
# - codec_type=audio (aac)  ✅
```

### Check Logs
Look for these messages when creating assignment:
```
🎤 Generating narration audio from X segments...
✅ Audio synthesized: XXXX bytes
🎬 Combining video with narration audio...
✅ Video and audio combined successfully: XXXX bytes
```

## 📋 Requirements

- ✅ **ffmpeg** installed (`brew install ffmpeg`)
- ✅ **ElevenLabs API key** configured
- ✅ **Manim** installed for video generation

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Only NEW assignments** will have audio in videos
   - Existing assignments created before this fix remain silent
   - To fix old assignments: delete and recreate them

2. **File naming changed**:
   - Old: `visual.mp4` (silent video)
   - New: `visual_silent.mp4` → `visual.mp4` (with audio)

3. **Fallback behavior**:
   - If ffmpeg not found: uses silent video
   - If narration fails: uses silent video
   - Always creates usable video, audio is enhancement

### Student View - Playing Video
- Click Visual tab
- Video plays with animation
- **Voice narration explains the content** ← NEW!
- Audio matches the visual progression

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Video still silent?**
- Check: `which ffmpeg` (should return path)
- Check: ElevenLabs API key is valid
- Check: Server logs for errors

**Audio doesn't match video?**
- Expected: `-shortest` flag syncs duration
- Video/audio end together (whichever is shorter)

**ffmpeg errors?**
- Install: `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS)
- Verify: `ffmpeg -version`

## 📁 Files Modified

- `app/services/assignment_service.py`
  - Line 202-222: Visual variant generation with audio
  - Line 660-708: New `_add_audio_to_video()` method

## ✨ Result

**Before**: 🎬📹 (silent videos)
**After**: 🎬🔊 (videos with professional narration)

All new Manim videos now include ElevenLabs voiceover narration automatically!
